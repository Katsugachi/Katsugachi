## I’m currently working on ...
#### Solus Ms
A gaming site, with every trick in the book, invisibility cloaking, tab cloaking etc. <br>
But most of all, actual full games that aren't cheap ripoffs of the original game<br><br>

#### Calculator 2
The Grand Swiss Army Knife Of All Calculators. <br>
This is a special site and if you hit the save offline button it will allow you to visit this site even when you have no internet <br>

#### Project Cardboard
Technically speaking, a cardboard box is worth more than I am, and probably you are too, at around 1.2 billion dollars though falling through that property would take 42 minutes...don't trespass<br><br>
